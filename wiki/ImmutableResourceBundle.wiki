#summary Provides structured access to application resources

= Introduction =

 The resources in a deployed GWT application can be roughly categorized into resources to never cache `.nocache.js`, to cache forever `.cache.html`, and everything else `myapp.css`.  The proposed ImmutableResourceBundle interface seeks to move entries in the everything-else category into the cache-forever category.

= Goals =

  * No more uncertainty if your application is getting the right contents for program resources.
  * Decrease non-determinism caused by intermediate proxy servers.
  * Enable more aggressive caching headers for program resources.
  * Eliminate mismatches between physical filenames and constants in Java code by performing consistency checks during the compile.
  * Use of 'data:' URLs, JSON bundles, or other means of embedding resources in compiled JS when browser- and size-appropriate to decrease the number of round-trips entirely.
  * Provides an extensible design for adding new implementation strategies.
  * Ensure there is no penalty for having multiple ImmutableResourceBundle resource functions refer to the same content.
  * To optionally include statistics about the number and size of resources used by your application.

= Non-Goals =

  * To provide a file-system abstraction

= Examples =

To use the ImmutableResourceBundle, add an inherits tag to your `gwt.xml` file:
{{{
<inherits name="com.google.gwt.libideas.ImmutableResources" />
}}}

Interfaces:
{{{
public interface MyResources extends ImmutableResourceBundle {
 public static final MyResources INSTANCE =  (MyResources) GWT.create(MyResources.class);

 /** @gwt.resource myApp.css */
 public TextResource css();

 /** @gwt.resource myConfiguration.xml */
 public TextResource initialConfiguration();

 /** @gwt.resource com/foo/bar/binaryFile.bin */
 public DataResource otherFile();
}
}}}

You can then say:
{{{
  Window.alert(MyResources.INSTANCE.css().getText());
  new Frame(MyResources.INSTANCE.otherFile().getURL());
}}}

= Potential pitfalls =
  * Changing the content of the resources will change the filenames (or data: encoding), thus forcing a recompile of the GWT application. To avoid this, the inlining and renaming features can be globally toggled off in your gwt.xml file during the development phase.
  * Inlining files into the compiled JS may not make sense if those files are not always accessed by the program, thus inlining should be configurable on a per-resource or per-ImmutableResourceBundle basis.


= Future possibilities =
  * Automatic, distributed cache warming.  This could be especially useful for popular apps to pre-distribute resources into intermediate proxy servers.
  * Google Gears resource store integration.
  * If the GWT compiler is re-targeted at widget- or gadget-likeenvironments, they may have particular requirements for packaging and referencing external resources.
