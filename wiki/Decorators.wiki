#summary This is a description of the decorator class and how it is used.

= Introduction =
The core GWT widgets need to be as efficient as possible. Yet, there are many use cases where you would love to have one extra set of divs etc. right here. 
The `Decorator` class is the solution to this problem.

= Details =
Each `Decorator` must represent a single static html decorator. Each decorator must be initialized with to DOM elements, in specific the template, and the element within the template to hang the contents off of. Here is an example decorator
{{{
      Element root = DOM.createDiv();
      root.setClassName("demo-decorator");
      // In this case the root and the element to attach are the same.
      Element toAttach = root;
      Decorator myDecorator = new Decorator(root, toAttach);
}}}


 There are two ways to use decorators, you can either have them wrap a node or a string. Each widget which is decorator aware should provide templated methods
