#summary working with eclipse and gwt incubator.
 
= Step one =

[http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/source/browse/trunk/eclipse/README.txt Follow the GWT eclipse setup instructions] 

Also, you probably want the [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ subeclipse project] as well.

= Step two  =
Set the following classpath variables

====`GWT_HOME`==== 
Set to the directory containing the gwt jars you want to use.

====`GWT_TOOLS`====
Set to your gwt tools directory.
 
= Step three =
Import the `gwt-incubator-resources` project from the eclipse directory at the root of your subversion workspace. You'll need the one appropriate for you computer. 

For example, a windows developer will choose `eclipse\incubator-resources-windows` when Eclipse prompts to "Select root directory".
