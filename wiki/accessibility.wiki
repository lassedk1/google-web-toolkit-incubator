= Introduction =
This document is intended to cover some proposed enhancements to the current GWT accessibility support.

|| Priority || High ||
|| Level of effort required || High ||


== Justification ==
While the visual impaired are certainly a large percentage of people that require accessibility, another important group is those that are not able to use a mouse due to physical handicaps. For them, having an application be fully keyboard navigable is absolutely critical.
== Challenges ==
Here we list some of the problems that must be solved in order to implement complete keyboard accessibility.  
 
==== When is a navigation key actually available for navigation? ====
  *  A text box consumes its Left-arrow, but not if it is at the beginning of its input. Similarly, it consumed its Right-arrow, but not if it is at the end of its input.
  * A DateBox needs to defer to its underlying text box to determine which navigation keys are consumed, except if its DatePicker is currently showing. In that case, the DateBox should allow the DatePicker to determine which navigation keys are consumed.
  * A Cell-based selectable grid consumes all the arrow key. A row selectable grid only consumed the Up-arrow and Down-arrow keys.

==== If a navigation key is available for navigation, what should be done with it? ====
  * Tab order is the "typical" way to navigate an html form.  Should that be messed with?
  * In a grid control that has a selected cell, the four arrow keys should move the selected cell, and only move focus if the element in the cell is focusable.
  * In a grid control that can select rows, but not cells, the up and down arrows should move the selection, what should the left and right arrows do?
  * If the container is not navigation aware, what should it do with the navigation keys?
  * How should containers that switch their children be navigated? (Stack Panel, TabPanel)
  * How should containers like DisclosurePanel be navigated? 
==== How should we deal with elements not in the normal form-flow? ===
  * How should menus always be accessed?
  * How should popups be closed?
== Solution ==
Terminology:
|| Focusable Widget || A widget which implements the Focusable interface, all others are assumed to be non focusable ||
|| Cell Selectable Grid || A grid which has a cell highlighted, Date Picker is an example ||
|| Row Selectable Grid || A grid which as a row highlighted ||
|| Leaf Navigation Widget || A widget whose navigation typically consists of navigating within its own state or between leaf elements.  Textbox, DateBox, DatePicker, Tree are examples of such. || 
|| Container Navigation Widget || A widget which typically navigates a set of containers. TabPanel, StackPanel, DocPanel are examples of such ||

==== Constraints on all widgets ====    
 * All navigation should be done on key down events.
 * Each widget that uses a navigation key must consume it by calling stopPropagation on that key. 
 * Each widget must also NOT consume the key if it did not actually use it. For instance, as a TextBox does not use a left arrow if it is at the beginning of its input, it must not consume that left arrow.
