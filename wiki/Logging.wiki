#summary DRAFT GWT Logging API.

= Introduction =
A client side logging API. The GWT logging prototype draws heavily from the [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/util/logging/overview.html Java logging API]
and the [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-log/ gwt log] project by Fred Sauer.

= Design Goals =
  # No overhead for logging messages when logging is disabled.
  # Simple lightweight API.  
  # Familiar to Java Programmers

 
= Design Decisions =

==Single on/off deferred binding==
The Logging api has a single boolean property (logging:on/off).  The other option would be to have a set of predefined levels i.e. logging(off/fine/finer/.../severe). Both are good options, so far we believe the single switch will lead to best full experience.

Advantages for multiple levels:
  # No overhead for logging levels not used when compiled with a GWT 1.5 compiler
  # One field can be used to deploy the correct logging levels for automated systems.


Advantages of single on/off switch
  # Simple model: Intuitive easy to understand that logging level comes from runtime and logging support comes from compile time.
  # Encourages what we believe is the best deployment model:
    # One production system without logging
    # One "debug" system with logging
  # Avoid the big mistake of compiling 10 different variants of the code with 10 different logger levels.

= Design overview =

== Logger ==
Logger is a static class. Its API is modeled on the java Logger API.

== Handler ==
A Handler is a class which actually handles the logging messages.  Its API is modeled in the java Handler class.  Its subclasses will be drawn almost exclusively from the gwt-log  subclasses of AbstractLogger.

 
== Level ==
Defines the current logging Level. Based on the java logging Level class.
