#summary Compile-time CSS processing
#labels Phase-Implementation,Type-Library

=Goals=

  * Primary
    * Compatibility with non-GWT-aware CSS parsers (i.e. any extensions should be valid CSS syntax)
      * This does not imply that the stylesheet would necessarily make sense if you just displayed it in a browser
    * Syntax validation
    * Minification
    * Leverage GWT compiler
      * Different CSS for different browsers, automatically
      * Static evaluation of content
  * Secondary
    * Basic CSS Modularization
      * Via dependency-injection API style
      * Widgets can inject their own CSS only when it's needed
    * BiDi (Janus-style?)
    * CSS image strips
    * "Improve CSS"
      * Constants
      * Simple expressions
  * Tertiary
    * Runtime manipulation (StyleElement.setEnabled() handles many cases)
    * Compile-time class-name checking (Java/CSS)
    * Obfuscation


=Non-Goals=
  * Server-side manipulation


=Use Cases=

  * Constants (*Working*):
{{{
@def small 1px;
@def black #000;
border: small solid black;
}}}
    * The parse rules make it difficult to use delimiting tokens for substitutions
    * Redefining built-in sizes allows users to write plain CSS to draft a style and then tweak it.
    * Suggest that users use upper-case names, similar to static final members.
  * Runtime substitution (*Working*)
{{{
@eval userBackground com.module.UserPreferences.getUserBackground();
background: userBackground;
}}}
    * Provides runtime support for evaluating static methods when the stylesheet is injected.  Triggered / dynamic updates could be added in the future if we allow programmatic manipulation of the style elements.
      * If the user-defined function can be statically evaluated by the compiler, then the implementation of the specific CssResource should collapse to just a string literal.
    * This allows easy support for non-structural skinning changes.
    * Generated implementations of CSSResources can do fast string slicing since offsets of substitutions are known at compile time.
    * Allow an @import statement for unqualified names?
    * CSSResource.getText() or CSSResource.inject() necessary
  * Compile-time import (_TODO_)
{{{
@import cssResourceFunctionName;
}}}
    * What does this mean?
      * Is this a preprocessor-like #include?  If so, it is problematic to have an n:1 relationship?
      * Is this like a Java static import where we just inherit metadata like @def or @url?
    * To what extent is this actually necessary?  The point of the @import statement is to allow for source and deployment modularization.  Source modularization can be achieved by using multiple CssResource interfaces and we're only concerned with static resources in the Bundle.
    * The @import statement will only work for other CssResources, not for URLs at runtime, since the `.gwt.xml` or StyleInjector can be used in those cases.
  * Runtime structural changes (*Working*)
{{{
/* Runtime evaluation in a static context */
@if com.module.Foo.staticBooleanFunction() {
  ... css rules ...
}

/* Compile-time evaluation */
@if <deferred-binding-property> <space-separated list of values> {
  ... css rules ...
}
@if user.agent safari gecko1_8 { ... }
@if locale en { ... }

/* Negation is supported */
@if !user.agent ie6 opera {
  ...
}
}}}
    * This allows for more advanced skinning / theming / browser quirk handling by allowing for structural changes in the CSS.
    * The contents of an @if block can be anything that would be a top-level rule in a CSS stylesheet.
    * @if blocks can be nested.  No support for @else or @elif since conditional CSS is usually used to "fix up" browser quirks.
    * What does it mean to have an @def or @eval in an @if block?  Easy to make this work for property-based @if statements; would have to generate pretty gnarly runtime code to handle the expression-based @if statement.  Could have block-level scoping; but this seems like a dubious use-case.
    * If the function in the first form can be statically evaluated in a permutation, there is no runtime cost.  The second form will never have a runtime cost because it is evaluated during compilation.
  * CSS Image Sprites (*Working*):
{{{
@sprite mySpriteClass imageResourceFuncName; => generates =>
  .mySpriteClass {
    background-image: url(gen.png);
    clip: ...;
    width: 27px;
    height: 42px;
  }
}}}
{{{
class MyCssResource extends CssResource {
  Sprite mySpriteClass();
}

class MyResources extends ImmutableResourceBundle {
  @Resource("my.css")
  MyCssResource css();
}

myResources.css().mySpriteClass().apply(someElement)
}}}
    * @sprite is sensitive to the FooBundle in which the CSSResource is declared; a sibling ImageResource method named in the @sprite declaration will be used to compose the background sprite.
    * @sprite entries will be expanded to static CSS rules, possibly with data: urls
    * The only way to make this work on ie6 is to modify the structure of the element.  For @style (and maybe a general class of meta-styles), the CssResource member function returns a MetaStyle instance with an apply(Element e) method.  The contract is that the Element passed in will be modified to have the meta-style applied.  The effects of the application depend on the specifics of the meta-style.
  * References to DataResources (*Working*)
{{{
@url myBackgroundUrl siblingDataResource;

.myClass {
  background: myBackgroundUrl repeat-x;
}
}}}
    * The identifier will be expanded to `url('some_url')`
  * BiDi (_Open RFC_):
    * Can this be accomplished using just the skinning support and some pre-cooked recipes?
    * Perhaps a magic @if predicate
{{{
@if :rtl {
  ... ...
}

@if !:rtl {
  ... ...
}
}}}
    * Perhaps a magic substitution property value
{{{
direction: auto;
}}}
    * Perhaps use 'special pseudo-classes'
{{{
.myClass:rtl{}
div:rtl{} => generates =>
  .myClass {
    direction: <correct value>
    text-align: <correct value>
  }
}}}
  * Compile-time name checking (*Working*):
{{{
java:
    class Resources {
      MyCSSResource myCSSResource();
    }
    class MyCSSResource extends CSSResource {
      Sprite mySpriteClass();
      String someOtherClass();
      String hookClass();
    }
    myWidget.addStyleName(resource.mySpriteClass());

css:
    @sprite mySpriteClass mySpriteImage;
    .someOtherClass {
      /* ... */
    }
    .hookClass{} /* Empty and stripped, but left for future expansion */
}}}
    * The function just returns the CSS class name, but verifies that the CSS class exists in the stylesheet.
      * _TODO_: Add an @external annotation to allow a "binding" to a site-wide css file
    * No typos.
    * Possibility of using obfuscated names for programmatically-accessible class names. For obfuscation, we'll use a Adler32 checksum of the source css file expressed in base36 as a prefix (7 chars). The developer can override this with an annotation.
  * Implementation fix-ups (~~Not planned~~):
{{{
    div:hover { }
       Could use top-level event handler to fake on IE
    div:focus { }
       Problematic -- focus/blur don't bubble
}}}

=Important open questions=
  * Can we manipulate style rules across browsers?
    * Maybe make MyCSSResource.mySpriteClass() return Rule object
    * The @eval rule implies that stylesheets must be removable or can be updated in-place.
    * Does doing so update actual rendering on all browsers?
  * Other meta-classes
    * @Opacity
    * @RoundedCorners
      * Can we generalize the meta-classes into an extensible Java provider API?
