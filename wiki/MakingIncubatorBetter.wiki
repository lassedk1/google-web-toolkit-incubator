= Introduction =
This page explains how to develop with the gwt-incubator source.  

One of the most important things to remember is that gwt-incubator should be compiled against the most current *released* version of GWT. So, right now that would be gwt 1.4.
 
= Setting up the incubator project =
== Setup for Eclipse ==
 # Follow the instructions [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/eclipse/README.txt here] to set up your eclipse environment ^note: use IE does not display this page correctly^
 # Check out the following code
   # The GWT prerequisite tools and third party library code. Use `gwt/tools` directly if you have them installed. Otherwise download them here:
     {{{~/gwt-incubator$ svn checkout http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/tools/ tools}}}
   # Check out the Incubator source:
     {{{~/gwt-incubator$ svn checkout http://google-web-toolkit-incubator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ trunk-read-only }}}
 # Create a new eclipse project from the existing source
 # In the properties tab go to Java Build Path --> Libraries. 
   # Add the `gwt-user` and `gwt-dev` jars from [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/download.html here]
   # Add the `javaswf-20050404.jar` from your downloaded tools directory 
   # Add the junit jar using the eclipse "Add Library option". Select junit3 
You now should be completely set up. 
== Setup for other IDEs==
We would much appreciate instructions here, if you are motivated to add them, add them as a comment below and I'll pull them up to this section.
=Contributing to Incubator=
Before deciding to contribute source code to the incubator project, you should consider the questions below
  # Do you have a signed Google Contributors Agreement(found [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/makinggwtbetter.html#clas here])?
  # Do you believe your source code should become part of the GWT code base?
  # Can you provide sample code, unit tests, and javadoc for your code base? 
  # Does your source code work on Internet Explorer, !FireFox, Opera, and Safari? 
  # Are you willing, for next couple of months, to  
    * Fix all critical bugs in your code
    * Answer outstanding design questions
If the answer to all the questions above is "yes", then your next step is to mail 
Google-Web-Toolkit-Contributors@googlegroups.com with the little "Looking for Incubator sponsor for _synopsis of code_."

example:
  Looking for Incubator sponsor for DatePicker.

At this point someone who already is a committer to gwt-incubator must be willing to sponsor your code. You will work with the sponsor to get the code into shape for submittal.  You may then petition to become a committer to gwt-incubator.
