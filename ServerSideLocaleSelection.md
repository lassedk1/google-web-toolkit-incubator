# Introduction #

For internationalized GWT applications, ideally the server would select the default locale based on the user's language preference settings in his/her browser.  These are normally supplied as part of the HTTP request in the Accept-Language header (many users do not have this configured correctly, so you still need to provide a way for the user to change the locale).  Aside from the contents of the Accept-Language header, you also need a list of the locales which the application was compiled with.

This document describes [LocaleListLinker](http://google-web-toolkit-incubator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/com/google/gwt/libideas/linker/LocaleListLinker.java), which generates a text file containing the compiled locales, and [LocaleMatcher](http://google-web-toolkit-incubator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/com/google/gwt/libideas/server/LocaleMatcher.java), which chooses an available locale which best matches the user's preferences.


# Details #

## `LocaleListLinker` ##

This class is a Linker which produces a text file containing all the locales which were compiled into your GWT app.  It is used as follows in your .gwt.xml file:
```
  <define-linker name="localeList" class="com.google.gwt.libideas.linker.LocaleListLinker"/>
  <set-linker name="std,localeList"/>
```
(note that you should set the linkers to include whatever other linkers you want)

After compile, the output will be in `www/modulename/localeList/locale-list.txt` -- your deployment process should then include this file in a way that it can be accessed by the deployed server code.

## `LocaleMatcher` ##

This class is used to select the proper locale for a given request.  It is initialized with an `InputStream` containing the `locale-list.txt` file generated by the above linker (or other means).  Sample usage:
```
  // Setup code
  Resource resource = Resource.newResource("my_deployed_app_path/localeList/locale-list.txt");
  LocaleMatcher localeMatcher = new LocaleMatcher(resource.getInputStream());

  // Per-request code for the host html page
  String locale = localeMatcher.findBestMatch(request.getHeader("Accept-language"));
  // Store the selected locale in the host html page to be served, via
  // <meta name='gwt:property' content='locale=<<locale>>'>

  // Be sure to include a Vary: Accept-language header in the response.
```
